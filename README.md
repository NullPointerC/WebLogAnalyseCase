# Log data cleaning

This is my course design of introduction to data science. Introduction to data science is an introduction course to teach some big data application technologies. In this course, I learned the origin of big data ecosphere and key technologies of big data, such as GFS, MapReduce, big table and so on. Finally, I completed this course design alone. My course design uses Hadoop, MapReduce, Linux, hive, etc, Sqoop, HBase, mysql, ecarts and other technologies
